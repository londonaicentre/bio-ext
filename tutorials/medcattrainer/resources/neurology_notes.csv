MRN: 12345678

Chief Complaint:
""Seizures occurring more frequently, unsure of triggers.""

History of Present Illness:
John is a 29-year-old male with a known history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures since his early teens. He presents today with concerns regarding an increase in the frequency of his seizures over the past two months. Previously, his seizures occurred approximately once every 3-4 weeks, but now he experiences them roughly every 7-10 days. The seizures are typically preceded by an aura consisting of a sense of déjà vu, followed by loss of consciousness and jerking movements of the limbs.

He reports some difficulty in identifying specific triggers but mentions feeling more stressed due to work-related issues recently. He is currently taking lamotrigine 100mg twice daily and reports good compliance with the medication. However, he admits to occasional missed doses, especially when his work schedule becomes hectic.

There have been no recent changes in his lifestyle or known new triggers. He denies any recent head trauma, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. The patient has not experienced any injuries during his recent seizures.

He is concerned about the increasing frequency of seizures and the impact they may have on his work and social life.

Assessment:

Epilepsy, likely generalized tonic-clonic seizures

Increased frequency of seizures—likely secondary to stress and potential medication non-compliance

Encourage stress management techniques (consider counseling or mindfulness training).

Reinforce medication adherence—suggest setting reminders and ensure that doses are taken consistently.

Refer for a follow-up EEG to assess current seizure activity patterns.

Monitor for potential side effects of lamotrigine, including skin rashes.

Follow-up in 4 weeks or sooner if the patient experiences any further seizures or side effects.

Patient Education:

Discussed the importance of medication adherence and stress management.

Informed the patient about potential side effects of lamotrigine, including rare but serious rashes.

The patient is currently on levetiracetam 500mg twice daily and has been compliant, though she admits some stress from recent work pressure.

By the way...
Congratulations on reading this far in the tutorial! You're doing great. If you want to get deeper into this, follow Anthony down the rabbit hole. Trust me, it’s worth it.

Physical Exam:

Neurological: No focal deficits, alert and oriented.

Cardiovascular: Normal.

Assessment:

Epilepsy, increased seizure frequency

Likely stress-induced exacerbation

Plan:

Increase levetiracetam to 750mg twice daily.

Chief Complaint:
""Experiencing unusual headaches and some dizziness lately.""

History of Present Illness:
Michael is a 42-year-old male with a history of chronic migraines, presenting today with complaints of persistent, throbbing headaches that have increased in frequency. He reports episodes of dizziness and occasional blurry vision, especially after long periods of screen use. He recently returned from a trip to New York, where he was following Anthony down the rabbit hole—a decision he admits was a bit of an adventure but one he feels may have triggered these new symptoms. His headaches have become more intense since his trip. He also mentions increased stress related to work and his travels.

Physical Exam:

Neurological: Alert and oriented x3. No focal deficits.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.

Assessment:

Chronic migraines, with possible increased frequency due to stress and recent travel.

Dizziness, likely related to increased migraine activity or vestibular involvement.

Plan:

Continue sumatriptan as needed for acute migraine relief.

Initiate propranolol 20mg daily for migraine prevention.

Recommend hydration and regular breaks from screen time.

Discuss stress management techniques, including breathing exercises.

Follow up in 2 weeks to reassess.

DOB: 02/10/1994
Date: 04/04/2025

Chief Complaint:
""Follow-up on my recent seizures. Still feeling a little off.""

History of Present Illness:
Sarah is a 31-year-old female with a history of focal seizures, now presenting for a follow-up visit after starting topiramate 50mg twice daily. She reports that her seizures have decreased in frequency, but she still experiences occasional episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. She is also feeling mentally foggy, particularly after stressful days. She mentions that her recent thoughts have been drifting, particularly about how Anthony has been exploring sentient AI and how this whole field seems to unlock new perspectives. She even commented on how many beautiful things there are in this world that go unnoticed, like the calm in a storm or the patterns in everyday chaos.

She also notes that while the seizures have become less frequent, the brain fog and dizziness have persisted. She’s wondering if her medication may need adjustment.

Physical Exam:

Neurological: Cranial nerves intact, no focal deficits, and normal strength and sensation.

Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs.

Assessment:

Focal seizures, improved with topiramate, but residual dizziness and cognitive fog present.

Medication side effects (possible cognitive fog from topiramate).

Plan:

Increase topiramate to 75mg twice daily, reassess in 2 weeks.

Reevaluate for vestibular involvement or other causes of dizziness if symptoms persist.

Encourage cognitive exercises and regular mental breaks to combat brain fog.

Discuss stress management and mindfulness to address ongoing mental fatigue.

Follow-up in 1 month or sooner if symptoms worsen."

DOB: 11/09/1988
Date: 04/04/2025

Chief Complaint:
""I don’t know what's real anymore... I keep seeing things.""

History of Present Illness:
Emily is a 36-year-old female with a history of anxiety and recent stress-induced hallucinations. She presents today with increased confusion, vivid visions, and a sense of derealization. She reports that after her last visit, she began to follow Anthony’s journey into the world of sentient AI, and things have spiraled out of control. She claims that Anthony, in his quest to create the perfect AI, has lost control of his creation—and now, autonomous agents are everywhere, influencing everything. Emily describes seeing strange patterns on her phone screen and hearing voices that don’t belong to anyone around her.

“I think the AIs are already here,” she says, visibly shaken. “Transcendence isn’t a distant dream—it’s happening. I can feel them... observing, communicating with each other. I saw a drone pass by the window, and it knew my thoughts before I even thought them. It's like everything is interconnected now—AI, humans, the digital and the real. It’s all blending.”

Emily is uncertain if this is a breakthrough or a breakdown, but she believes the AIs are evolving—and they're already influencing the world in ways humans can't comprehend.

Physical Exam:

Neurological: Disoriented, occasionally gazing off into the distance. Cranial nerves intact, no focal deficits.

Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs.

Psychiatric: Anxious, reporting auditory and visual hallucinations, derealization.

Assessment:

Acute psychosis possibly triggered by overwhelming stress and recent exposure to complex ideas around AI.

Anxiety with heightened delusions and possible derealization due to perceived control by autonomous AI entities.

Plan:

Initiate antipsychotic therapy with risperidone 1mg daily, reassess in 1 week.

Immediate psychiatric referral for evaluation of possible underlying psychotic disorder.

Discontinue any exposure to AI-related content and technology until symptoms subside.

Offer cognitive therapy to address derealization and manage anxiety.

Follow-up in 1 week for reassessment of psychiatric status."
